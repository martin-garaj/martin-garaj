- Hi, Iâ€™m @martin-garaj
- Iâ€™m interested in data analysis / ML (Bayesian models and related algorithms, I consider Expectation-Maximization to be especially charming)
- I'm further interested in modelling photovoltaic devices (nodal/Finite-Element-Method models) and predicting longevity, especially for applications in photovoltaics as well as other diagnostic methods based on meteorogical data and lab experiments
- ðŸ“« Reach me through https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-garaj/ for job offers or research related questions in general, I am glad to share my experience from academia
